I am Chetan S Tharkoti a student of mathematics. Currently I am doing a reding project in Algebraic Geometry (vector bundles) under the supervision of [Dr. Jyoti Dasgupta](https://sites.google.com/view/jyotidasgupta/home). Before this I did a reading project on Sheaf Cohomology at [IISER TVM](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Dr Sarbeswar Pal](https://iisertvm.irins.org/profile/94153)
