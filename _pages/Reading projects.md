Masters thesis: A theorem of Kunz and structure theorems for Complete local rings
======
Guide : Dr. Viji Z Thomas (IISER TVM).

In the first part of the project I studied the Valuation rings, Completion of rings and modules from Matsumura and a Theorem by Kunz from Characteristic 𝑝-Techniques in Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry the notes by Karen E Smith. In the second phase of the project I studied 0-smoothness, Separability over Rings, The module of Kälher differentials, 𝐼-smoothness of Rings and using those we studied the Structure theorems for complete local rings from Matsumura.


Algebraic Geometry : Cohomology
======
Guide : Dr Sarbeswar Pal (IISER TVM)

Derived functor, sheaf cohomology, cohomology of Noetherian Affine Scheme, Cech Cohomology, The cohomology of projective space (the first 5 sections of ch 3: cohomology of the book ALgebraic Geometry by R. Hartshrone) after covering the basics in scheme theory.


Algebraic Geometry : Classification of algebraic vector bundles on a connected, smooth, projective algebraic curve 𝑋 of genus 𝑔
======
Guide : Dr Jyoti Dasgupta (IIT-ISM)

Currently reading the first part of the book ’Lectures on Vector Bundles’ by J. Le
Potier
